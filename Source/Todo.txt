Todo:

-Split screen into quadrants and all 3 projection planes
-Change text commands to accomodate new user interaction requirements
-Set up normalized device coordinates (each quadrant takes up 1/4 pixels of the full screen size)
-Selection of polygons needs to update across all screens
-Modify draw scene to draw to all quadrants
-Set up transformations


Code removed:
Took out Clipping algorithms
Took out FindPolyCentroid()
Took out 2d transforms for now
Took out ClipScene()
